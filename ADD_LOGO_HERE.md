# URGENT: Add Your Gold Mafia Logo

## Quick Steps:

1. Save your Gold Mafia logo image (the one with GM letters, crown, and laurel leaves)

2. Rename it to: **`goldmafia-logo.png`**

3. Place it in this exact location:
   ```
   a:\github\gold mafia\GoldMafia\public\images\goldmafia-logo.png
   ```

## Then Update the Code:

After you add the logo file, update these two lines in `app\page.tsx`:

### Line ~406 (Landing Page):
Change from:
```tsx
src="/placeholder-logo.png"
```
To:
```tsx
src="/images/goldmafia-logo.png"
```

### Line ~107 (Dashboard):
Change from:
```tsx
src="/placeholder-logo.png"
```
To:
```tsx
src="/images/goldmafia-logo.png"
```

## Right Now:
- The placeholder logo is showing (a generic logo)
- Once you add `goldmafia-logo.png` to `public/images/` and update the paths, your actual logo will appear

## Test It:
After adding the file:
1. Save your logo as `public/images/goldmafia-logo.png`
2. Refresh your browser
3. You should see your Gold Mafia logo!
