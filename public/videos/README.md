### Midjourney Generation Prompt:

```
# Hero Landing Video

The landing page works perfectly without the video! The video is **optional** and the page already has:
- âœ… Static hero image (`gold-mafia-hero-one.jpeg`) as background
- âœ… All animations (sparkles, glow, float effects)
- âœ… Full functionality

## If You Want to Add Video (Optional)

Generate a video with Midjourney using this prompt:
